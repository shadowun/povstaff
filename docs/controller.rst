Soldering
=======================
Solder the male headers to the ItsyBitsy; for ItsyBitsy M4, only solder the
headers along the two long sides of the board. Now solder the POV shield board
to these headers underneath the Itsy Bitsy, forming a "sandwich" of two boards
as shown in the photos above. Note: all components of the POV shield should be
on the outside, not inside the sandwich!


After you are done soldering, use diagonal cutters to trim the long pins of the
headers so they are not in the way.
