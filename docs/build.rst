Building instructions
*********************
Below you can find the instructions for building your own POV staff. These
instructions assume that you are using a kit of parts bought from my
`Tindie store <https://www.tindie.com/stores/irobotics/>`__. Some information
on modifying these instructions if you want to source your components independently
is given in section FIXME.


You will need the following materials:

* Kit of parts from https://www.tindie.com/stores/irobotics/

* APA102 (DotStar) LED strip, 144 LED/meter, black PCB. They are  found from
  many vendors, including  `Adafruit <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241>`__
  and a number of vendors on Amazon and Aliexpress, such as `<https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32322326979.html>`__.
  You need 4 strips of 50cm (72 LEDs) each; you can also buy longer strips
  and cut them into 50cm pieces. The strips should **not** be waterproofed
  (sometimes this is listed as IP30). Adafruit strips come with waterproof
  silicone sheathing which you can just remove and discard.

* Two 18650 Li-Ion batteries. Look for high-capacity (at least 3000mAh),
  **protected batteries** from a reputable manufacturer such as Panasonic, Samsung,
  or Sanyo; I recommend `these batteries
  <https://www.18650batterystore.com/collections/button-top-18650-batteries/products/panasonic-18650-protected>`__
  by Panasonic. Do not try to  save money by buying a no-name battery on eBay or Amazon.

* Polycarbonate tube, `11F(55in/141cm) <https://flowtoys.com/long-tubes-5f-to-13f>`__,
  1 inch outer diameter, from flowtoys.com

* 1/2 inch square wood dowel, from HomeDepot or any other hardware store.
  You need 4 ft (or two 2ft pieces)

In addition, you will need some spray black paint, a soldering iron, and some
common tools: sharp knife, saw (for cutting wood dowel), diagonal cutters for
trimming header pins, scissors. Needless to say, you will also need a computer
to program the microcontroller and a USB charger to charge the batteries.
