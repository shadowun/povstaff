Overview of build steps
========================

The assembled staff will consist of the following subassemblies:

* Two 18650 batteries and wiring in the middle of the staff. The batteries are
  separated from each other and from LED assemblies by 3d printed spacers; total
  length of the batteries+spacers is about 25 cm.

* Two LED assemblies, one on each side of the staff. Each assembly consists of
  two 50 cm LED strips attached to a wood dowel. The LED strips will be soldered
  to a round power distribution board at the interior end of the dowel. The LED
  assembly are connected to each other and battery by JST XH connectors,
  plugging into the headers on power distribution boards.

* At one end of the staff, there is a switch, with two wires leading from it to
  the batteries in the middle and protected by a PVC endcap with an opening for the
  switch

* At the opposite end of the staff, the controller, consisting of the ItsyBitsy
  microcontroller attached to the custom POV shield board, protected by PVC endcap.
  A 4-wire cable is plugged into the JST XH header on the POV shield; the wires
  run the length of LED assembly to the center

* Tennis racket grip tape covering the battery assembly in the middle of the
  staff, for better grip.
