Making the LED assemblies
============================


1. Take the 1/2 inch wood dowels and cut them using hacksaw to produce two
   pieces of 52cm each. Try to keep your cuts square.

2. Spray-paint the pieces black and leave to dry. This will give the staff a
   much more polished look (while it is off; once it is on, no one will notice
   what color the dowels are).

3. Get the LED strip(s). If they are inside waterproof sheaving, remove and
   discard the sheaving. If they have any wires soldered, de-solder them;
   remove excess solder using a braid wick. If you ordered 1m or 2m strips, cut
   them into 50 cm pieces, making sure to leave as large as possible soldering
   pads in the beginning of each strip (this should be easy, as usually longer
   strips are created by soldering together 50cm ones, so you will be just
   undoing someone else's work).

4. Using your soldering iron, tin the pads in the beginning of each LED strip.
   Take the solid core wire included in the kit of parts; strip insulation from
   about 2cm  long piece but do not cut it. Using the insulated part to hold the
   wire, solder it to the top pad on the strip. You will be soldering very
   close to the first LED, so please watch your iron carefully - do not touch the LED!
   After soldering, cut the soldered piece and repeat the process with all
   other pads. The end result should look similar to the one shown below:


5. Now    
All APA102 strips have 4 signal lines: Ground (GND, commonly abbreviated G), Clock (CLK, or CI for Clock In), Data (DAT, or DI), and VCC, or 5V. However, the order of these signal lines on the strips is varies between manufacturers. Thus, now is a good time to write it down for future use. Put the strip on the desk with the beginning of the strip to the left, and write down the signals, going from top to bottom and labeling them A... D. For example, for the strip in the photos above you would get the following list:
A=GND
B=CLK
C=DAT
D=VCC
Keep this list readily available through the rest of assembly - you will refer to it more than once.

Remove the backing paper from the adhesive strip on the back of the LED and attach the strip to the wood dowel so that the plastic spacers on the soldered headers are flush with the end of the dowel. Attach the other strip to the opposite side of the dowel. Repeat with the other dowel.
Take the power distribution boards and solder them to the headers as shown in the photos. The boards should be flush with the end of the wood dowel. Use diagonal cutters to cut off extra length of header pins.
You should now have two completed LED assemblies.
Note: the adhesive on LED strips is not very strong, so your strips might start peeling off. It is OK; we will make a more permanent attachment later.
